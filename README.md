# One touch Localisation

This project helps to achieve localisation with ease rather than changing the app region and app locale of the app which forces the user to restart the app every time they set the language 

This is possible with the help of setting the localisable files during the run time.




# LocalizationManager

This class delegates the localisation operations in the app just by setting the locale during the  runtime

     LocalizationManager.setLanguageTo("en")
